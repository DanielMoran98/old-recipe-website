	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Daniel Moran and I am from Dublin, Ireland. I am a first year student currently attending the BN013, '<em>Science in Computing</em> ' course in Institute of Technology Blanchardstown. I am in the first semester and so far I am really enjoying it. The contents of the course are very interesting to me as you get to understand how computers work at a very detailed level. There are also alot of other modules in the course that teach you other skills such as problem solving, how to think logically and also how to use various languages to create websites and programs. The modules that we are studying currently in Semester 1 include:

	<ul class = "coloredBullets">
			<li> Computer Systems </li>
			<li> Programming </li>
			<li> Web Development </li>
			<li> Networking </li>
			<li> Personal and Professional Development </li>
			<li> Algorithmic Provlem Solving </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Before coming to ITB, I graduated from a 1 year course in Computers and Networks at Colaiste Ide which had similar content to my current course, except instead of Web Development, I did Mobile Development. The secondary school I attended was Beneavin College, Finglas which was where I took my leaving cert.
	</p>
	<p>
		My plans for the future would be to graduate with a Bachelor of Science (Honors) after 4 years at ITB. I may even consider doing a masters degree if my grades are good enough. After college I would like to go for a career as a Software Engineer or a role similar that involves programming. I would also like to maintain this website in the future and try to improve it as I gain more knowledge in HTML and CSS
	</p>
	<p> I have a lot of interests but my main interests would be, going out with friends, playing games, new technology, music, and of course cooking!
